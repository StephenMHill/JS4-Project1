# javascript_proj1

this project has been fun and a rollercoaster

Day 1: Make all files completed with CSS assuming that was what was required.
        Made 3 pages in total. tried to figure out what features I needed to add. 
        Tried audio files on click events, but nothing seemed to work or fit right.
        Turns out I had overcomplicated the project.
Day 3: added a login feature but it did not work right away. got it to work. It is not a true login, as it does not interact with a server and frankly doesn't do                   anything other then appear to be a login.
Day4: Talked to Phil and understand how to proceed. I will complete the instialltion of node modules, update the gitignore, remove all files (saving them somewhere else),      delete the repository and commit everything step by step to simulate the process of adding features.
